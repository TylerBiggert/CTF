# Main Ideas
- Original query must not be properly sanitized or paramaterized.
  - The query needs to just insert in the untrusted user into.
  - The query directly inserts user input values as variables.
- Properly escape the start and end of the query.
- Create a new query to run.
  - Test the query at https://www.db-fiddle.com/
- Match the return type of the original query to get results back.
- Send multiple SQL functions to run inside one input query.

# Check For Missing Paramaterization

## SQL Injection Likely
```
query = f"SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='{inputVarHere}'"
```
```
query = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE username='" + inputVarHere + "'"
```

## SQL Injection Unlikely
```
query = "INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (%s)"
```
```
query = "INSERT INTO users (username) VALUES (?)"
```
