# Order of Review

1) Dockerfile / Architecture
   1) Identify the app artitecture
2) Notes/Other
   1) Readme and notes files will have hints inside them
3) Flag.txt
   1) If this file exists then the contents have the flag
   2) Can you access the file directly
   3) Can you write the flag.txt contents somewhere else
   4) Can you use path traversal
   5) Can you display the file contents from the template
4) Database
   1) What database type is it (SQLLite, PostgresSQL, MySQL)
      1) This will effect SQL syntax
   2) What data is stored
      1) Is one of the records the flag?
   3) What tables and fields are there
      1) (Optiona) Recreate the databse inside DB Fiddle if you later find SQL Injection is likely
5) Static/Assets
   1) Probably not important, but open all files for hints
6) Main Component
   1) What is the app doing
   2) Do any SQL queries directly insert variables
      1) Unparameterized SQL queries will be open to SQL Injection
   3) Blacklist/Denylist/CustomFilters
      1) If the app uses a blacklist of values instead of a whitelist then this is likely open to attack
   4) Can you reverse engineer any of the checks
7) Main Template
   1) What input can you provide
      1) File upload
   2) What data is shown
      1) Is any data shown from user input
8) What's Weird
   1) Is the app compiled in debug mode
   2) Are components being exported
   3) Does something look weird or out of place
   4) Are some functions not used by the app
