# Find the Malware
- Webpage
  - Look in the Debugger/Sources tab and go through the files

# Unconver the Payload
  - Find what is trying to be ran
    - Option1: Open the source in VSC
      - Zoom the editor out so the text is small
      - Look through the files for (BIG BLOCKS or LONG STRINGS) of encoded text that look out of place
    - Option2: Search for common hacks 'powershell', 'exec:', 'cmd', 'command', 'run', '.exe'
  - Decode/Decrypt the payload (base64, hex, ...)
