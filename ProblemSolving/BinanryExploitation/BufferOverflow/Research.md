# Review Source Code
## Stack Overflow Likely
- Input is read by `scanf()`
- Input string has defined character length
  - `char inputFromUser[16];`
  - Make note of how many characters it is expecting because additional characters will start overriding memmory.

## Other Clues
- What variables are defined beneath user input variables?
  - You will be able to overflow into the variables below the user input
- 'Canary' variable is defined

# Fuzz Application
- Does the application allow for user input?
  - Add as many `A` characters as your can. Does the app break?
